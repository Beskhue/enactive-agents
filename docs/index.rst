============================
EnactiveAgents documentation
============================

EnactiveAgents is an implementation of the Enactivist Cognitive Architecture in Python.

.. ATTENTION::
   EnactiveAgents is currently in development and is unstable.
   
The implementation is set up to be *scriptable*, *adaptable* and *pluggable*:
   
- Scriptable: experiments can easily be set up. The architecture and specific experiment logic are decoupled.
- Adaptable: the architecture is implemented with the model-view-controller design pattern, and is highly object oriented. This makes adding or modifying functionality straightforward.
- Pluggable: the implementation makes as few assumptions as possible about data formats, e.g. different types of agents can be interchanged.
